# Pizza Sales Report

The Project is all about the getting the detailed visualization using PowerBI for the pizza Orders dataset.Totally i created two Dashboard named home and Bets/Worst Sellers and then i used navigator for navigating between these two dashboards. I have csv dataset which was downloaded on internet. I used SQL SERVER MANAGEMENT STUDIO 19, for checking the wheather our Visualization giving exact output or not.

Steps Followed\
-> First Loaded CSV file into the PowerBI.\
-> Used Power Query editor for updating and creating new columns that neeed for the creating dashboard.\
-> I extracted Name of the Day,Month and Day,Month number using Order_date column which was presnt in the dataset.\
-> Created new measures for Total Orders,Total Pizzas sold,Total Revenue, Average Order Value and Average Pizzas Per day. And then i used new card for the above five measures.\
-> For Icons I used https://freeicons.io/iconset/latest-icons freeicons website.\
-> I Used column chart for Daily Trend for Total Orders. Area Chart for Monthly Total Orders Trend. Donut chart for both Percentage of Sales by pizza category and Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size. Funnel for Total pizzas sold by pizza category.\
-> I used Slicers for the Pizza category as normal and for date i used between for showing the dashboard for that particular dates.\
-> And then in the next page I used bar chart for 6 things i.e. for Top/Bottom 5 pizzas by Revenue, Top/Bottom 5 pizzas by quantity and finally for Top/Bottom 5 pizzas by Orders. For the bars i used conditional formating giving minimum and maximum colors for the different reveune,quantity,Orders.\
